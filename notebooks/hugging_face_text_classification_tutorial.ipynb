    "\n",
    "Text classification is the process of assigning a category to a piece of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a category can be almost anything and a piece of text can be a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph or entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example text classification problems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Problem** | **Description** | **Problem Type** |\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "| Spam/phishing email detection | Is an email spam or not spam? Or is it a phishing email or not? | Binary classification (one thing or another) |\n",
    "| Sentiment analysis | Is a piece of text positive, negative or neutral? Such as classifying product reviews into good/bad/neutral. | Multi-class classification (one thing from many) |\n",
    "| Language detection | What language is a piece of text written in? | Multi-class classification (one thing from many) |\n",
    "| Topic classification | What topic(s) does a news article belong to? | Multi-label classification (one or more things from many) |\n",
    "| Hate speech detection | Is a comment hateful or not hateful? | Binary classification (one thing or another) |\n",
    "| Product categorization | What categories does a product belong to? | Multi-label classification (one or more things from many) |\n",
    "| Business email classification | Which category should this email go to? | Multi-class classification (one thing from many) | \n",

    "Text classification is a very common problem in many business settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a project I've worked on previously as a machine learning engineer was building a text classification model to classify different insurance claims into `claimant_at_fault`/`claimant_not_at_fault` for a large insurance company. \n",

It includes customer-submitted text such as 'Someone crashed into my car' and 'I accidentally crashed into someone's letterbox'. These texts are processed through an insurance app by Lime Insurance Co. and input into a model that determines fault based on the text. The classification outputs are 'Not at Fault' and 'At Fault', allowing claims to be forwarded to the appropriate department.

    "Tokenization is the process of converting a non-numerical data source into numbers.\n",

    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because machines (especially machine learning models) prefer numbers to human-style data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the text `\"I love pizza\"` a very simple method of tokenization might be to convert each word to a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `{\"I\": 0, \"love\": 1, \"pizza\": 2}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most modern machine learning models, the tokenization process is a bit more nuanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the text `\"I love pizza\"` might be tokenized into something more like `[101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102]`.\n",

The left image displays the text segmented into tokens with colors indicating different words, illustrating 'People like words.' The right image shows the same text converted into numerical token IDs, demonstrating 'Machines prefer numbers.' The text is split into 11 tokens, translating to numerical values that the machine can process, highlighting how natural language is transformed for machine understanding.\" \n",

    "     <figcaption>Although it may seem like you can type text directly to machine learning models, behind the scenes they are converting it to numbers first. This happens for all kinds of data being passed to machine learning models. It goes from its raw form (e.g. text, image, audio) and gets turned into a numerical representation (often called tokenization) before it is processed by the model. Exactly how data gets turned into numbers will often be different depending on the model. This example shows the use of <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\">OpenAI's GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 tokenizer</a>.</figcaption>\n",

    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the model you use, the tokenization process could be different. \n",

    "\n",
    "To deal with this, Hugging Face models often pair models and tokenizers together by name. \n",

    "Such is the case with [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) (there is a `tokenizer.json` file as well as a `tokenizer_config.json` file which contains all of the tokenizer implementation details). \n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples of tokenization, you can see OpenAI's [tokenization visualizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) as well as their open-source library [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), Google also have an open-source tokenization library called [`sentencepiece`](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece), finally Hugging Face's [`tokenizers`](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library is also a great resource (this is what we'll be using behind the scenes).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Why use the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased` model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is that I've used it before and it works well (and fast) on various text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also performed well in the [original research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) which introduced it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer answer is that Hugging Face has many available open-source models for many different problems available at [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating these models can take some practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "And several models may be suited for the same task (though with various tradeoffs such as size and speed).\n",

    "## Setting up an evaluation metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from training a model, one of the most important steps in machine learning is evaluating a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do, we can use evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation metric attempts to represent a model's performance in a single (or series) of numbers (note, I say \"attempts\" here because evaluation metrics are useful to guage performance but the real test of a machine learning model is in the real world).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of evaluation metrics for various problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since we're focused on text classification, we'll use [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification) as our evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model which gets 99/100 predictions correct has an accuracy of 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{correct classifications}}{\\text{all classifications}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For some projects, you may have a minimum standard of a metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when I worked on an insurance claim classification model, the clients required over 98% accuracy on the test dataset for it to be viable to use in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, we can craft these evaluation metrics ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Hugging Face has a library called [`evaluate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/index) which has various metrics built in ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can load a metric using `evaluate.load(\"METRIC_NAME\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load in `\"accuracy\"` and build a function to measure accuracy by comparing arrays of predictions and labels."

    "4. Pass `TrainingArguments` from 3 and target datasets to an instance of [`transformers.Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer).\n",
    "5. Train the model by calling [`Trainer.train()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.40.2/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.train).\n",
    "6. Save the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\n",
    "7. Evaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\n",
    "8. Turn the model into a shareable demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating an instance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working on text classification, we'll do so with `transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification` (where sequence classification means a sequence of something, e.g. our sequences of text).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `from_pretrained()` method to instatiate a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",

    "The \"pretrained\" in [`transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.42.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained) means acquiring a model which has already been trained on a certain dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is common practice in many machine learning projects and is known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to take an existing model which works well on a task similar to your target task and then **fine-tune** it to work even better on your target task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we're going to use the pretrained DistilBERT base model ([`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased)) which has been trained on [many thousands of books](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpus/bookcorpus) as well as a version of the [English Wikipedia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/legacy-datasets/wikipedia) (millions of words).\n",
    "\n",

    "We'll take this baseline representation of the patterns in language and adjust it slightly to focus specifically on predicting whether an image caption is about food or not (based on the words it contains).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Ability to get good results with smaller amounts of data (since the main representations are learned on a larger dataset, we only have to show the model a few examples of our specific problem).\n",
    "2. This process can be repeated acorss various domains and tasks. For example, you can take a computer vision model trained on millions of images and customize it to your own use case. Or an audio model trained on many different nature sounds and customize it specifically for birds.\n",

    "You'll notice that the model comes in 3 main parts (data flows through these sequentially):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `embeddings` - This part of the model turns the input tokens into a learned representation. So rather than just a list of integers, the values become a learned representation. This learned representation comes from the base model learning how different words and word pieces relate to eachother thanks to its training data. The size of `(30522, 768)` means the `30,522` words in the vocabulary are all represented by vectors of size `768` (one word gets represented by 768 numbers, these are often not human interpretable).\n",
    "2. `transformer` - This is the main body of the model. There are several `TransformerBlock` layers stacked on top of each other. These layers attempt to learn a deeper representation of the data going through the model. A thorough breakdown of these layers is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however, for and in-depth guide on Transformer-based models, I'd recommend reading [*Transformers from scratch*](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) by Peter Bloem, going through [Andrej Karpathy's lecture on Transformers and their history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfpMkf4rD6E) or reading the original [*Attention is all you need*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper (this is the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture).\n",
    "3. `classifier` - This is what is going to take the representation of the data and compress it into our number of target classes (notice `out_features=2`, this means that we'll get two output numbers, one for each of our classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the entire DistilBert architecture and its training setup, I'd recommend reading the [*DistilBert paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) from the Hugging Face team.\n",

    "|:-----|:-----|\n",
    "| `output_dir` | Name of output directory to save the model and checkpoints to. For example, `learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_model`.  |\n",
    "| `learning_rate` | Value of the initial learning rate to use during training. Passed to [`transformers.AdamW`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments). Initial learning rate because the learning rate can be dynamic during training. The ideal learning is experimental in nature. Defaults to `5e-5` or `0.00001` but we'll use `0.0001`.  |\n",
    "| `per_device_train_batch_size`| Size of batches to place on target device during training. For example, a batch size of `32` means the model will look at 32 samples at a time. A batch size too large will result in out of memory issues (e.g. your GPU can't handle holding a large number of samples in memory at a time). |\n",
    "| `per_device_eval_batch_size` | Size of batches to place on target device during evaluation. Can often be larger than during training because no gradients are being calculated. For example, training batch size could be 32 where as evaluation batch size may be able to be 128 (4x larger). Though these are only esitmates. |\n",
    "| `num_train_epochs` | Number of times to pass over the data to try and learn patterns. For example, if `num_train_epochs=10`, the model will do 10 full passes of the training data. Because we're working with a small dataset, 10 epochs should be fine to begin with. However, if you had a larger dataset, you may want to do a few experiments using less data (e.g. 10% of the data) for a smaller number of epochs to make sure things work. |\n",
    "| `eval_strategy` | When to evaluate the model on the evaluation data. If `eval_strategy=\"epoch\"`, the model will be evaluated every epoch. See the documentation for more options. **Note:** This was previously called `evaluation_strategy` but was shortened in `transformers==4.46`. |\n",
    "| `save_strategy` | When to save a model checkpoint. If `save_strategy=\"epoch\"`, a checkpoint will be saved every epoch. See the documentation for more save options. |\n",
    "| `save_total_limit` | Number of total amount of checkpoints to save (so we don't save `num_train_epochs` checkpoints). For example, can limit to 3 saves so the total number of saves are the 3 most recent as well as the best performing checkpoint (as per `load_best_model_at_end`). |\n",

    "\n",
    "We've saved our model locally and confirmed that it seems to be performing well on our training metrics but how about we push it to the Hugging Face Hub?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face Hub is one of the best sources of machine learning models on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can add our model there so others can use it or we can access it in the future (we could also keep it private on the Hugging Face Hub so only people from our organization can use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing models on Hugging Face is also a great way to showcase your skills as a machine learning engineer, it gives you something to show potential employers and say \"here's what I've done\".\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Before sharing a model to the Hugging Face Hub, be sure to go through the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup a Hugging Face token using the [`huggingface-cli login` command](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli).\n",
    "2. Read through the [user access tokens guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).\n",
    "3. Set up an access token via [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (ensure it has \"write\" access).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Google Colab, you can add your token under the \"Secrets\" tab on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "On my local computer, my token is saved to `/home/daniel/.cache/huggingface/token` (thanks to running `huggingface-cli login` on the command line).\n",
    "\n",
    "And for more on sharing models to the Hugging Face Hub, be sure to check out the [model sharing documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We can push our model, tokenizer and other assosciated files to the Hugging Face Hub using the [`transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.push_to_hub) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also optionally do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a [model card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards) (something that describes how the model was created and what it can be used for) using [`transformers.Trainer.create_model_card`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.create_model_card).\n",
    "* Add a custom `README.md` file to the model repository to explain more details about the model using [`huggingface_hub.HfApi.upload_file`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/upload#upload-a-file). This method is similar to model card creation method above but with more customization.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Pipeline mode** using [`transformers.pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.42.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) and passing it our target model, this allows us to preprocess custom data and make predictions in one step.\n",
    "2. **PyTorch mode** using a combination of [`transformers.AutoTokenizer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.42.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) and [`transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.42.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) and passing each our target model, this requires us to preprocess our data before passing to a model, however, it offers the most customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predictions one at a time (batch size of 1), for example, one person using the app at a time.\n",
    "2. Batches of predictions at a time (predictions with a batch size of `n` where `n` can be any number, e.g. `8`, `16`, `32`), for example, many people using a service simultaneously such as a voice chat and needing to filter comments (predicting on batches of size `n` is usually much faster than batches of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever method we choose, we'll have to set the target device we'd like the operations to happen on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's best to make predictions on the most powerful accelerator you have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in most cases that will be a NVIDIA GPU > Mac GPU > CPU.\n",

    "Let's see how we can create a pipeline for our text classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate an instance of `transformers.pipeline`.\n",
    "2. Pass in the `task` parameter of `text-classification` (we can do this because our model is already formatted for text classification thanks to using `transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification`).\n",
    "3. Setup the `model` parameter to be `local_model_path` (though we could also use `huggingface_model_path`).\n",
    "4. Set the target device using the `device` parameter.\n",
    "5. Set `top_k=1` to get to the top prediction back (e.g. either `\"food\"` or `\"not_food\"`, could set this higher to get more labels back).\n",
    "6. Set the `BATCH_SIZE=32` so we can pass to the `batch_size` parameter. This will allow our model to make predictions on up to `32` samples at a time. Predicting on batches of data is usually much faster than single samples at a time, however, this often saturates at a point (e.g. predicting on batches of size 64 may be the same speed as 32 due to memory contraints).\n",
    "\n",

    "One of the best ways to share your machine learning work is by creating an application.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Manually** - By going to the [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) website and clicking \"Create new space\". Or by going directly to [https://www.huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space). Here, you'll be able to setup a few settings for your Space and choose the framework/runtime (e.g. Streamlit, Gradio, Docker and more).\n",
    "2. **Programmatically** - By using the [Hugging Face Hub Python API](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/hf_api) we can write code to [directly upload files to the Hugging Face Hub](https://www.gradio.app/guides/using-hugging-face-integrations#hosting-your-gradio-demos-on-spaces), including Hugging Face Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are great options but we're going to take the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is so we can create our Hugging Face Space right from this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we'll create three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `app.py` - This will be the Python file which will be the main running file on our Hugging Face Space. Inside we'll include all the code necessary to run our Gradio demo (as above). Hugging Face Spaces will automatically recoginize the `app.py` file and run it for us.\n",
    "2. `requirements.txt` - This text file will include all of the Python packages we need to run our `app.py` file. Before our Space starts to run, all of the packages in this file will be installed.\n",
    "3. `README.md` - This markdown file will include details about our Space as well as specific Space-related metadata (we'll see this later on).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create these files with the following file structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "demos/\n",
    "└── food_not_food_text_classifier/\n",
    "    ├── app.py\n",

    "    └── requirements.txt\n",

    "Why this way?\n",

    "Doing it in the above style means we'll have a directory which contains all of our demos (`demos/`) as well as a dedicated directory which contains our `food`/`not_food` demo application (`food_not_food_text_classifier/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we'll be able to upload the whole `demos/food_not_food_text_classifier/` folder to Hugging Face Spaces.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be very proud of yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "We've just gone end-to-end on a machine learning workflow with Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "From loading a dataset to training a model to deploying that model in the form of a public demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the main takeaways from this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Hugging Face ecosystem is a collection of powerful and open-source tools for machine learning workflows.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hugging Face `datasets` helps you to store and preprocess datasets of almost any shape and size.\n",
    "* Hugging Face `transformers` has many built-in pretrained models for many different use cases and components such as `transformers.Trainer` help you to tailor those models to your own custom use cases.\n",
    "* Hugging Face `tokenizers` works closely with `transformers` and allows the efficient conversion of raw text data into numerical representation (which is required for machine learning models). \n",
    "* The Hugging Face Hub is a great place to share your models and machine learning projects. Over time, you can build up a portfolio of machine learning-based projects to show future employers or clients and to help the community grow.\n",
    "* There are many more, but I'll leave these for you to explore as extra-curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A common machine learning workflow: dataset -> model -> demo.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a machine learning model is incorporated into a larger application, a very common workflow is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find an existing or create a new dataset for your specific problem.\n",
    "2. Train/fine-tune and evaluate an existing model on your dataset.\n",
    "3. Create a small demo application to test your trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've just gone through all of these steps for text classification! \n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a very common problem in many business settings. If you have a similar problem but a different dataset, you can replicate this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building your own model has several advantages over using APIs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are very helpful to try something out.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, depending on your use case, you may often want to create your own custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training your own model can often result in faster predictions and far less running costs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face ecosystem enables the creation of custom models for almost any kind of machine learning problem."

    "## Exercises and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no better way to improve other than practicing what you've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises and extensions are designed for you to practice the things we've covered in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our text classification model works on `food`/`not_food` text samples. How would you create your own binary text classification model on different classes?\n",
    "    * Create ~10 or samples of your own text classes (e.g. 10 samples each of `spam`/`not_spam` emails) and retrain a text classification model.\n",
    "    * Bonus: Share the model you've made in a demo just like we did here. Send it to me, I'd love to see it! My email is on [my website](https://www.mrdbourke.com).\n",
    "2. We've trained our model on two classes (binary classification) but how might we increase that to 3 or more classes (multi-class classification)?\n",
    "    * Hint: see the `num_labels` parameter in `transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification`. \n",
    "3. Our model seems to work pretty good on our test data and on the few number of examples we tried manually. Can you find any examples where our model fails? For example, what kind of sentences does it struggle with? How could you fix this?\n",
    "    * Hint: Our model has been trained on examples with at least 5-12 words, does it still work with short sentences? (e.g. \"pie\").\n",
    "    * Bonus: If you find any cases where our model doesn't perform well, make an extra 10-20 examples of these and add them to the dataset and then retrain the model (you'll have to lookup [\"how to add rows to an existing Hugging Face dataset\"](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-do-i-add-things-rows-to-an-already-saved-dataset/27423)). How does the model perform after adding these additional samples?\n",
    "4. Datasets are fundamental to any machine learning project, getting to know how to process and interact with them is a fundamental skill. Spend 1 hour going through the [Hugging Face Datasets tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/tutorial).\n",
    "    * Write 5 things you can do with Hugging Face Datasets and where they might come in handy.\n",
    "5. The Hugging Face `transformers` library has many features. The following readings are to help understand a handful of them.\n",
    "    * Spend 10 minutes exploring the [`transformers.TrainingArguments` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments).\n",
    "    * Spend 10 minutes reading the [`transformers.Trainer` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer).  \n",
    "    * Spend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face [model sharing documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_sharing).  \n",
    "    * Spend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face [`transformers.pipeline` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines).  \n",
    "        * What does a `pipeline` do?\n",
    "        * Name 3 different kinds of pipelines and describe what they do in a sentence\n",
    "6. Gradio is a powerful library for making machine learning demos, learning more about it will help you in future creations. Spend 10-15 minutes reading the [Gradio quickstart documentation](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart). \n",
    "    * What are 3 kinds of demos you can create?\n",
    "    * What are 3 different inputs and outputs you can make?"
