    "text": "Glossary\n\nTransformer = A deep learning model that adopts the attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output\nTokenization = turning a series of data (text or image) into a series of tokens, where a token is a numerical representation of the input data, for example, in the case of text, tokenization could mean turning the words in a sentence into numbers (e.g. “hello world” -&gt; [101, 102])\nTokens = a token is a letter, word or word-piece (word) that a model uses to represent input data, for example, in the case of text, a token could be a word (e.g. “hello”) or a word-piece (e.g. “hell” and “o”), see: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer for an example\ntransformers = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of pre-trained transformer models, fine-tuning tools, and utilities to use them\ndatasets = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of datasets for NLP and CV tasks\ntokenizers = A Python library by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of tokenizers for NLP tasks\nevaluate = A Python library by Hugging Face with premade evaluation functions for various tasks\ntorch = PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library\ntransfer learning = taking what one model has learned and applying it to another task (e.g. a model which has learned across many millions of words of text from the internet and then adjusting it to work with your smaller dataset)\nfine-tuning = a type of transfer learning where you take the existing patterns of one model (usually trained on a very large dataset) and customize them to work for your smaller dataset\nhyperparameters = values you can set to adjust training settings, for example, learning rate is a hyperparameter that is adjustable\nHugging Face Hub = Place to store datasets, models, and other resources of your own + find existing datasets, models & scripts others have shared. If you are familiar with GitHub, Hugging Face is like the GitHub of machine learning.\nHugging Face Spaces = A platform to share and run machine learning apps/demos, usually built with Gradio or Streamlit\nHF = Hugging Face\nNLP = Natural Language Processing\nCV = Computer Vision\nTPU = Tensor Processing Unit\nGPU = Graphics Processing Unit\nLearning rate = Often the most important hyperparameter to tune. It is proportional with the amount an optimizer will update a model’s parameters every update step. A higher amount means larger updates (though sometimes too large) a lower amount means smaller updates (though sometimes not enough). The most ideal learning rate is experimental. Common values include 0.001, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.00001, 0.00005 (though the learning rate can be any value). Many optimizers have decent default learning rates. For example, the Adam optimizer (a common and generally well performing optimizer) in PyTorch (torch.optim.Adam) has a default learning rate of 0.001. For fine-tuning an already trained model a learning rate of 10x smaller than the default is a good rule of thumb (e.g. if a model was trained with a learning rate of 0.001, fine-tuning with 0.0001 is common). The learning rate does not have to be static and can change dynamcially during training, this practice is referred to as learning rate scheduling.\nPrediction probability = the probability of a model’s prediction for a given input, is a score between 0 and 1 with 1 being the highest, for example, a model may have a prediction probability of 0.95, this would mean it’s quite confident with its prediction but it doesn’t mean it’s correct. A good way to inspect potential issues with a dataset is to show examples in the test set which have a high prediction probability but are wrong (e.g. pred prob = 0.98 but the prediction was incorrect).\nHugging Face Pipeline (pipeline) = A high-level API for using model for various tasks (e.g. text-classification, audio-classification, image-classification, object-detection and more), see the docs: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline\nloss value = Measure of how wrong your model is by a given metric. A perfect model will have a loss value of 0 (it is able to predict the data perfectly), though this is highly unlikely in practice (there are no perfect models). Ideally, the loss value will go down (towards 0) as training goes on. If the loss value on the training set is lower than the loss value on the test set, the model is likely overfitting (memorizing the training set too well rather than learning generalizable patterns to unseen data). To fix overfitting, introduce more regularization. To fix underfitting (loss not going down), introduce more learning capacity (more data, more parameters in the model, longer training). Machine learning is a constant battle between overfitting and underfitting.\nRandom seed = Value to flavour the randomness of an operation. For example, if you set a random seed to 42 the numbers produced by a random generator will be random but flavoured by the seed. This means if the seed stays at 42, subsequent calls of the same operation will return the same values. Not setting a random seed will result in different random values each time. Setting a random seed is done to ensure reproducibility of an operation. This is helpful when performing experiments and you do not want the outputs to be random each time."

We get back a dictionary with the keys text and label.\nThe text key contains the text of the image caption and the label key contains the label (food or not food).\n\n\n3.3 TK - Inspect random examples from the dataset\nAt 250 total samples, our dataset isn’t too large.\nSo we could sit there and explore the samples one by one.\nBut whenever I interact with a new dataset, I like to view a bunch of random examples and get a feel of the data.\nDoing so is inline with the data explorer’s motto: visualize, visualize, visualize!\nAs a rule of thumb, I like to view at least 20-100 random examples when interacting with a new dataset.\nLet’s write some code to view 5 random indexes of our data and their corresponding text and labels at a time.\n\nimport random\n\nrandom_indexs = random.sample(range(len(dataset[\"train\"])), 5)\nrandom_samples = dataset[\"train\"][random_indexs]\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random samples from dataset:\\n\")\nfor item in zip(random_samples[\"text\"], random_samples[\"label\"]):\n    print(f\"Text: {item[0]} | Label: {item[1]}\")\n\n[INFO] Random samples from dataset:\n\nText: Luxurious coconut shrimp curry on a generous plate, featuring succulent shrimp in a rich coconut milk sauce, served with jasmine rice. | Label: food\nText: Set of golf clubs stored in a bag | Label: not_food\nText: A bowl of sliced pears with a sprinkle of ginger and a side of honey | Label: food\nText: Celery in a bowl, served with a side of peanut butter and a sprinkle of raisins for a classic, tasty snack. | Label: food\nText: Set of forks kept in a holder | Label: not_food\n\n\nBeautiful!

Looks like our labels are all numerical now.\nWe can check a few random samples using dataset.shuffle() and indexing for the first few.\n\n# Shuffle the dataset and view the first 5 samples (will return different results each time) \ndataset.shuffle()[:5]\n\n{'text': ['Treadmill available in a home gym',\n  'Potatoes, onions, garlic, cauliflower, and broccolini in boxes at the market, ready for a tasty, healthy meal.',\n  'A slice of pizza with a generous amount of shredded parmesan cheese on top',\n  'A bowl of sliced bell peppers with a sprinkle of paprika and a side of hummus',\n  'Set of forks kept in a holder'],\n 'label': [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n\n\n\n\n4.2 TK - Split the dataset into training and test sets\nRight now our dataset only has a training split.\nHowever, we’d like to create a test split so we can evaluate our model.\nIn essence, our model will learn patterns (the relationship between text captions and their labels of food/not_food) on the training data.\nAnd we will evaluate those learned patterns on the test data.\nWe can split our data using the datasets.Dataset.train_test_split method.\nWe can use the test_size parameter to define the percentage of data we’d like to use in our test set (e.g. test_size=0.2 would mean 20% of the data goes to the test set).\n\n# Create train/test splits\ndataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, seed=42) # note: seed isn't needed, just here for reproducibility, without it you will get different splits each time you run the cell\ndataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 200\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 50\n    })\n})\n\n\nPerfect!\nOur dataset has been split into 200 training examples and 50 testing examples.\nLet’s visualize a few random examples to make sure they still look okay.\n\nrandom_idx_train = random.randint(0, len(dataset[\"train\"]))\nrandom_sample_train = dataset[\"train\"][random_idx_train]\n\nrandom_idx_test = random.randint(0, len(dataset[\"test\"]))\nrandom_sample_test = dataset[\"test\"][random_idx_test]\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random sample from training dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Text: {random_sample_train['text']}\\nLabel: {random_sample_train['label']} ({id2label[random_sample_train['label']]})\\n\")\nprint(f\"[INFO] Random sample from testing dataset:\")\nprint(f\"Text: {random_sample_test['text']}\\nLabel: {random_sample_test['label']} ({id2label[random_sample_test['label']]})\")\n\n[INFO] Random sample from training dataset:\nText: A couple enjoying a movie night on the couch with their pets snuggled close\nLabel: 0 (not_food)\n\n[INFO] Random sample from testing dataset:\nText: A bowl of sliced kiwi with a sprinkle of sugar and a side of yogurt\nLabel: 1 (food)\n\n\n\n\n4.3 TK - Tokenizing text data\nLabels numericalized, dataset split, time to turn our text into numbers.\nTokenization is the process of converting a non-numerical data source into numbers.\nWhy?\nBecause machines (especially machine learning models) prefer numbers to human-style data.\nIn the case of the text \"I love pizza\" a very simple method of tokenization might be to convert each word to a number.\nFor example, {\"I\": 0, \"love\": 1, \"pizza\": 2}.\nHowever, for most modern machine learning models, the tokenization process is a bit more nuanced.\nFor example, the text \"I love pizza\" might be tokenized into something more like [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102].\nTK image - showcase an example using OpenAI’s tokenization tool and what this looks like with “I love pizza”: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on the model you use, the tokenization process could be different. For example, one model might turn \"I love pizza\" into [40, 3021, 23317], where as another model might turn it into [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102].\nTo deal with this, Hugging Face models often pair models with their own tokenizers by pairing a tokenizer configuration with a model’s weights.\nSuch is the case with distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased (there is a tokenizer.json file as well as a tokenizer_config.json file which contains all of the tokenizer implementation details).\nFor more examples of tokenization, you can see OpenAI’s tokenization visualizer tool as well as their open-source library tiktoken, Google also have an open-source tokenization library called sentencepiece, finally Hugging Face’s tokenizers library is also a great resource (this is what we’ll be using behind the scenes).\n\n\nMany of the text-based models on Hugging Face come paired with their own tokenizer.\nFor example, the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model can be used with the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased tokenizer.\nWe can load the tokenizer for a given model using the transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained method and passing it the name of the model we’d like to use.\nThe transformers.AutoTokenizer class is part of a series of Auto Classes (such as AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoProcessor) which automatically loads the correct configuration settings for a given model.\nLet’s load the tokenizer for the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model and see how it works.\nUPTOHERE - “why this model?”, add reasoning to why the distilbert model, Hugging Face has many models, often it takes a bit of practice to see which is best to use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy use the distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased model?\nThe short answer is that I’ve used it before and it works well (and fast) on various text classification tasks.\nThe longer answer is that Hugging Face has many available open-source models for many different problems available at https://huggingface.co/models.\nNavigating these models can take some practice.\nAnd several models may be suited for the same task (though with various tradeoffs such as size and speed).\nHowever, overtime and with adequate experimentation, you’ll start to build an intuition on which models are good for which problems.\n\n\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path=\"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased\",\n                                          use_fast=True) # uses fast tokenization (backed by tokenziers library and implemented in Rust) by default, if not available will default to Python implementation\n\ntokenizer\n\nDistilBertTokenizerFast(name_or_path='distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased', vocab_size=30522, model_max_length=512, is_fast=True, padding_side='right', truncation_side='right', special_tokens={'unk_token': '[UNK]', 'sep_token': '[SEP]', 'pad_token': '[PAD]', 'cls_token': '[CLS]', 'mask_token': '[MASK]'}, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True),  added_tokens_decoder={\n    0: AddedToken(\"[PAD]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    100: AddedToken(\"[UNK]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    101: AddedToken(\"[CLS]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    102: AddedToken(\"[SEP]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n    103: AddedToken(\"[MASK]\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=False, special=True),\n}\n\n\nNice!\nThere’s our tokenizer!\nIt’s an instance of the transformers.DistilBertTokenizerFast class.\nYou can read more about it in the documentation.\nFor now, let’s try it out by passing it a string of text.\n\n# Test out tokenizer\ntokenizer(\"I love pizza\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\n\n# Try adding a \"!\" at the end\ntokenizer(\"I love pizza!\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 999, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nWoohoo!\nOur text gets turned into numbers (or tokens).\nNotice how with even a slight change in the text, the tokenizer produces different results?\nThe input_ids are our tokens.\nAnd the attention_mask (in our case, all [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) is a mask which tells the model which tokens to use or not. Tokens with a mask value of 1 get used and tokens with a mask value of 0 get ignored.\nThere are several attributes of the tokenizer we can explore.\n\ntokenizer.vocab will return the vocabulary of the tokenizer or in other words, the unique words/word pieces the tokenizer is capable of converting into numbers.\ntokenizer.model_max_length will return the maximum length of a sequence the tokenizer can process, pass anything longer than this and the sequence will be truncated.\n\n\n# Get the length of the vocabulary \nlength_of_tokenizer_vocab = len(tokenizer.vocab)\nprint(f\"Length of tokenizer vocabulary: {length_of_tokenizer_vocab}\")\n\n# Get the maximum sequence length the tokenizer can handle\nmax_tokenizer_input_sequence_length = tokenizer.model_max_length\nprint(f\"Max tokenizer input sequence length: {max_tokenizer_input_sequence_length}\")\n\nLength of tokenizer vocabulary: 30522\nMax tokenizer input sequence length: 512\n\n\nWoah, looks like our tokenizer has a vocabulary of 30,522 different words and word pieces.\nAnd it can handle a sequence length of up to 512 (any sequence longer than this will be automatically truncated from the end).\nLet’s check out some of the vocab.\nCan I find my own name?\n\n# Does \"daniel\" occur in the vocab?\ntokenizer.vocab[\"daniel\"]\n\n3817\n\n\nOooh, looks like my name is 3817 in the tokenizer’s vocab.\nCan you find your own name? (note: there may be an error if the token doesn’t exist, we’ll get to this)\nHow about “pizza”?\n\ntokenizer.vocab[\"pizza\"]\n\n10733\n\n\nWhat if a word doesn’t exist in the vocab?\n\ntokenizer.vocab[\"akash\"]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[30], line 1\n----&gt; 1 tokenizer.vocab[\"akash\"]\n\nKeyError: 'akash'\n\n\n\nDam, we get a KeyError.\nNot to worry, this is okay, since when calling the tokenizer on the word, it will automatically split the word into word pieces or subwords.\n\ntokenizer(\"akash\")\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 9875, 4095, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nIt works!\nWe can check what word pieces \"akash\" got broken into with tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids).\n\ntokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokenizer(\"akash\").input_ids)\n\n['[CLS]', 'aka', '##sh', '[SEP]']\n\n\nAhhh, it seems \"akash\" was split into two tokens, [\"aka\", \"##sh\"].\nThe \"##\" at the start of \"##sh\" means that the sequence is part of a larger sequence.\nAnd the \"[CLS]\" and \"[SEP]\" tokens are special tokens indicating the start and end of a sequence.\nNow, since tokenizers can deal with any text, what if there was an unknown token?\nFor example, rather than \"pizza\" someone used the pizza emoji 🍕?\nLet’s try!\n\n# Try to tokenize an emoji\ntokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokenizer(\"🍕\").input_ids)\n\n['[CLS]', '[UNK]', '[SEP]']\n\n\nAhh, we get the special \"[UNK]\" token.\nThis stands for “unknown”.\nThe combination of word pieces and \"[UNK]\" special token means that our tokenizer will be able to turn almost any text into numbers for our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that just because one tokenizer uses an unknown special token for a particular word or emoji (🍕) doesn’t mean another will.\n\n\nSince the tokenizer.vocab is a Python dictionary, we can get a sample of the vocabulary using tokenizer.vocab.items().\nHow about we get the first 5?\n\n# Get the first 5 items in the tokenizer vocab\nsorted(tokenizer.vocab.items())[:5]\n\n[('!', 999), ('\"', 1000), ('#', 1001), ('##!', 29612), ('##\"', 29613)]\n\n\nThere’s our '!' from before! Looks like the first five items are all related to punctuation points.\nHow about a random sample of tokens?\n\nimport random\n\nrandom.sample(sorted(tokenizer.vocab.items()), k=5)\n\n[('macau', 16878),\n ('##nia', 6200),\n ('resurrection', 15218),\n ('drops', 9010),\n ('organizers', 18829)]\n\n\n\n\n4.4 TK - Making a preprocessing function to tokenize text\nRather than tokenizing our texts one by one, it’s best practice to define a preprocessing function which does it for us.\nThis process works regardless of whether you’re working with text data or other kinds of data such as images or audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning data into numbers\n\n\n\nFor any kind of machine learning workflow, an important first step is turning your input data into numbers.\nAs machine learning models are algorithms which find patterns in numbers, before they can find patterns in your data (text, images, audio, tables) it must be numerically encoded first (e.g. tokenizing text).\nTo help with this, transformers has an AutoProcessor class which can preprocess data in a specific format required for a paired model.\n\n\nTo prepare our text data, let’s create a preprocessing function to take in a dictionary which contains the key \"text\" which has the value of a target string (our data samples come in the form of dictionaries) and then returns the tokenized \"text\".\nWe’ll set the following parameters in our tokenizer:\n\npadding=True - This will make all the sequences in a batch the same length by padding shorter sequences with 0’s until they equal the longest size in the batch. Why? If there are different size sequences in a batch, you can sometimes run into dimensionality issues.\ntruncation=True - This will shorten sequences longer than the model can handle to the model’s max input size (e.g. if a sequence is 1000 long and the model can handle 512, it will be shortened to 512 via removing all tokens after 512).\n\nYou can see more parameters available for the tokenizer in the transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more on padding and truncation (two important concepts in sequence processing), I’d recommend reading the Hugging Face documentation on Padding and Truncation.\n\n\n\ndef tokenize_text(examples):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tokenize given example text and return the tokenized text.\n    \"\"\"\n    return tokenizer(examples[\"text\"],\n                     padding=True, # pad short sequences to longest sequence in the batch\n                     truncation=True) # truncate long sequences to the maximum length the model can handle\n\nWonderful!\nNow let’s try it out on an example sample.\n\nexample_sample_2 = {\"text\": \"I love pizza\", \"label\": 1}\n\n# Test the function\ntokenize_text(example_sample_2)\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nLooking good!\nHow about we map our tokenize_text function to our whole dataset?\nWe can do so with the datasets.Dataset.map method.\nThe map method allows us to apply a given function to all examples in a dataset.\nBy setting batched=True we can apply the given function to batches of examples (many at a time) to speed up computation time.\nLet’s create a tokenized_dataset object by calling map on our dataset and passing it our tokenize_text function.\n\n# dataset.map() docs -&gt; https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.20.0/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map \ntokenized_dataset = dataset.map(function=tokenize_text, \n                                batched=True, # set batched=True to operate across batches of examples rather than only single examples\n                                batch_size=1000) # defaults to 1000, can be increased if you have a large dataset\n\ntokenized_dataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label', 'input_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 200\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['text', 'label', 'input_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 50\n    })\n})\n\n\nDataset tokenized!\nLet’s inspect a pair of samples.\n\n# Get two samples from the tokenized dataset\ntrain_tokenized_sample = tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0]\ntest_tokenized_sample = tokenized_dataset[\"test\"][0]\n\nfor key in train_tokenized_sample.keys():\n    print(f\"[INFO] Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Train sample: {train_tokenized_sample[key]}\")\n    print(f\"Test sample: {test_tokenized_sample[key]}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n[INFO] Key: text\nTrain sample: Set of headphones placed on a desk\nTest sample: A slice of pepperoni pizza with a layer of melted cheese\n\n[INFO] Key: label\nTrain sample: 0\nTest sample: 1\n\n[INFO] Key: input_ids\nTrain sample: [101, 2275, 1997, 2132, 19093, 2872, 2006, 1037, 4624, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest sample: [101, 1037, 14704, 1997, 11565, 10698, 10733, 2007, 1037, 6741, 1997, 12501, 8808, 102, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[INFO] Key: attention_mask\nTrain sample: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTest sample: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nBeautiful! Our samples have been tokenized.\nNotice the zeroes on the end of the inpud_ids and attention_mask values.\nThese are padding tokens to ensure that each sample has the same length as the longest sequence in a given batch.\nWe can now use these tokenized samples later on in our model.\n\n\n4.5 Tokenization takeaways\nWe’ve seen tokenizers in practice.\nA few takeaways before we start to build a model:\n\nTokenizers are used to turn text (or other forms of data such as images and audio) into a numerical representation ready to be used with a machine learning model.\nMany models reuse existing tokenizers and many models have their own specific tokenizer paired with them. Hugging Face’s transformers.AutoTokenizer, transformers.AutoProcessor and transformers.AutoModel classes make it easy to pair tokenizers and models based on their name (e.g. distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased).",

    "section": "1 TK - Overview",
    "text": "1 TK - Overview\n\n1.1 TK - What we’re going to build\nIn this project, we’re going to learn various aspects of the Hugging Face ecosystem whilst building a text classification model.\nTo keep things as practical as possible, we’re going to be bulding a food/not_food text classification model.\nGiven a piece of a text, our model will be able to predict if it’s about food or not.\nThis is the same kind of model I use in my own work on Nutrify (an app to help people learn about food).\nMore specifically, we’re going to follow the following steps:\n\nProblem defintion and dataset preparation - Getting a dataset/setting up the problem space.\nFinding, training and evaluating a model - Finding a text classification model suitable for our problem on Hugging Face and customizing it to our own dataset.\nCreating a demo and put our model into the real world - Sharing our trained model in a way others can access and use.\n\nBy the end of this project, you’ll have a trained model and demo on Hugging Face you can share with others.\nTK image - see the finished product (demo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote this is a hands-on project, so we’ll be focused on writing reusable code and building a model that can be used in the real world. If you are looking for explainers to the theory of what we’re doing, I’ll leave links in the extra-curriculum section.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 TK - What is Hugging Face?\nTK - perhaps put this in the front of the website? e.g. on the index page\nHugging Face is a platform that offers access to many different kinds of open-source machine learning models and datasets.\nThey’re also the creators of the popular transformers library which is a Python-based library for working with pre-trained models as well as custom models and datasets.\nIf you’re getting into the world of AI and machine learning, you’re going to come across Hugging Face.\n\n\n1.3 TK - Why Hugging Face?\nMany of the biggest companies in the world use Hugging Face for their open-source machine learning projects including Apple, Google, Facebook (Meta), Microsoft, OpenAI, ByteDance and more.\nTK image - image of people using Hugging Face\nNot only does Hugging Face make it so you can use state-of-the-art machine learning models such as Stable Diffusion (for image generation) and Whipser (for audio transcription) easily, it also makes it so you can share your own models, datasets and resources.\nConsider Hugging Face the homepage of your AI/machine learning profile.\n\n\n1.4 TK - What is text classification?\nText classification is the process of assigning a category to a piece of text.\nWhere a category can be almost anything and a piece of text can be a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph or entire document.\nTK image - example of text classification\nExample text classification problems include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nDescription\nProblem Type\n\n\n\n\nSpam email detection\nIs an email spam or not spam?\nBinary classification (one thing or another)\n\n\nSentiment analysis\nIs a piece of text positive, negative or neutral?\nMulti-class classification (one thing from many)\n\n\nLanguage detection\nWhat language is a piece of text written in?\nMulti-class classification (one thing from many)\n\n\nTopic classification\nWhat topic(s) does a news article belong to?\nMulti-label classification (one or more things from many)\n\n\nHate speech detection\nIs a comment hateful or not hateful?\nBinary classification (one thing or another)\n\n\nProduct categorization\nWhat categories does a product belong to?\nMulti-label classification (one or more things from many)\n\n\n\nThere are several different kinds of models you can use for text classification.\nAnd each will have its pros and cons depending on the problem you’re working on.\nExample text classification models include:\n\n\n\nModel\nDescription\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nRule-based\nUses a set of rules to classify text (e.g. if text contains “sad” -&gt; sentiment = low)\nSimple, easy to understand\nRequires manual creation of rules\n\n\nBag of Words\nCounts the frequency of words in a piece of text\nSimple, easy to understand\nDoesn’t capture word order\n\n\nTF-IDF\nWeighs the importance of words in a piece of text\nSimple, easy to understand\nDoesn’t capture word order\n\n\nDeep learning-based models\nUses neural networks to learn patterns in text\nCan learn complex patterns at scale\nCan require large amounts of data/compute power to run, not as easy to understand (can be hard to debug)\n\n\n\nWe’re going to use a deep learning model our case.\nWhy?\nBecause Hugging Face helps us do so.\nAnd in most cases, with a large enough dataset, a deep learning model will often perform better than a rule-based or other model.\n\n\n1.5 TK - Why train your own text classification models?\nYou can use pre-trained models for text classification as well as API-powered models and LLMs such as GPT-4 or Gemini.\nHowever, it’s often a good idea to train your own text classification models for a few reasons:\n\nThey can be much faster than API-powered models (since they’re running on your own hardware, this can save on costs and time).\nThey’re customized to your own data.\nThey don’t require you to send your data elsewhere (privacy).\nIf a service goes down, you’ll still have access to your model (reliability).\n\nTK image - example of training your own model vs using an API-powered model",

    "text": "5 Creating a mapping from labels to numbers\nOur machine learning model will want to see all numbers.\nThis goes for text as well as label input.\nSo let’s create a mapping from our labels to numbers.\nSince we’ve only got a couple of labels (\"food\" and \"not_food\"), we can create a dictionary to map them to numbers, however, if you’ve got a fair few labels, you may want to make this mapping programmatically.\nWe can use these dictionaries later on for our model training as well as evaluation.\n\n# Create mapping from id2label and label2id\nid2label = {0: \"not_food\", 1: \"food\"}\nlabel2id = {\"not_food\": 0, \"food\": 1}\n\nprint(f\"Label to ID mapping: {label2id}\")\nprint(f\"ID to Label mapping: {id2label}\")\n\nLabel to ID mapping: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\nID to Label mapping: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn a binary classification task, the positive class, in our case \"food\", is usually given the label 1 and the negative class (\"not_food\") is given the label 0.\n\n\n\n# Create mappings programmatically from dataset\nid2label = {idx: label for idx, label in enumerate(dataset[\"train\"].unique(\"label\")[::-1])} # reverse sort list to have \"not_food\" first\nlabel2id = {label: idx for idx, label in id2label.items()}\n\nprint(f\"Label to ID mapping: {label2id}\")\nprint(f\"ID to Label mapping: {id2label}\")\n\nLabel to ID mapping: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\nID to Label mapping: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\n\n\nWith our dictionary mappings created, we can update the labels of our dataset to be numeric.\nWe can do this using the datasets.Dataset.map method and passing it a function to apply to each example.\nLet’s create a small function which turns an example label into a number.\n\n# Turn labels into 0 or 1 (e.g. 0 for \"not_food\", 1 for \"food\")\ndef map_labels_to_number(example):\n  example[\"label\"] = label2id[example[\"label\"]]\n  return example\n\nexample_sample = {\"text\": \"This is a sentence about my favourite food: honey.\", \"label\": \"food\"}\n\n# Test the function\nmap_labels_to_number(example_sample)\n\n{'text': 'This is a sentence about my favourite food: honey.', 'label': 1}\n\n\nLooks like our function works!\nHow about we map it to the whole dataset?\n\n# Map our dataset labels to numbers\ndataset = dataset[\"train\"].map(map_labels_to_number)\ndataset[:5]\n\n{'text': ['Creamy cauliflower curry with garlic naan, featuring tender cauliflower in a rich sauce with cream and spices, served with garlic naan bread.',\n  'Set of books stacked on a desk',\n  'Watching TV together, a family has their dog stretched out on the floor',\n  'Wooden dresser with a mirror reflecting the room',\n  'Lawn mower stored in a shed'],\n 'label': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n\n\nNice!

    "text": "5 TK - Setting up an evaluation metric\nAside from training a model, one of the most important steps in machine learning is evaluating a model.\nTo do, we can use evaluation metrics.\nThere are many different kinds of evaluation metrics for various problems.\nBut since we’re focused on text classification, we’ll use accuracy as our evaluation metric.\nA model which gets 99/100 predictions correct has an accuracy of 99%.\n\\[\n\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{correct classifications}}{\\text{all classifications}}\n\\]\nFor some projects, you may have a minimum standard of a metric.\nFor example, when I worked on an insurance claim classification model, the clients required over 98% accuracy for it to be viable to use in production.\nWe can craft these evaluation metrics ourselves.\nHowever, Hugging Face has a library called evaluate which has various metrics built in ready to use.\nWe can load a metric using evaluate.load(\"METRIC_NAME\").\nLet’s load in \"accuracy\" and build a function to measure accuracy by comparing arrays of predictions and labels.\n\nimport evaluate\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\naccuracy_metric = evaluate.load(\"accuracy\")\n\ndef compute_accuracy(predictions_and_labels: Tuple[np.array, np.array]):\n  \"\"\"\n  Computes the accuracy of a model by comparing the predictions and labels.\n  \"\"\"\n  predictions, labels = predictions_and_labels\n\n  # Get highest prediction probability of each prediction if predictions are probabilities\n  if len(predictions.shape) &gt;= 2:\n    predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)\n\n  return accuracy_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)\n\nAccuracy function created!\nNow let’s test it out.\n\n# Create example list of predictions and labels\nexample_predictions_all_correct = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\nexample_predictions_one_wrong = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\nexample_labels = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\n# Test the function\nprint(f\"Accuracy when all predictions are correct: {compute_accuracy((example_predictions_all_correct, example_labels))}\")\nprint(f\"Accuracy when one prediction is wrong: {compute_accuracy((example_predictions_one_wrong, example_labels))}\")\n\nAccuracy when all predictions are correct: {'accuracy': 1.0}\nAccuracy when one prediction is wrong: {'accuracy': 0.9}\n\n\nExcellent, our function works just as we’d like.\nWhen all predictions are correct, it scores 1.0 (or 100% accuracy) and when 9/10 predictions are correct, it returns 0.9 (or 90% accuracy).\nWe can use this function during training and evaluation of our model.",

    "text": "6 TK - Setting up a model for training\nWe’ve gone through the important steps of setting data up for training (and evaluation).\nNow let’s prepare a model.\nWe’ll go through the following steps:\n\nCreate and preprocess data (done ✅).\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model.\nEvaluate results.\n\n\nTK image - steps for training in Hugging Face\n\nLet’s start by creating an instance of a model.\nSince we’re working on text classification, we’ll do so with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (where sequence classification means a sequence of something, e.g. our sequences of text).\nWe can use the from_pretrained() method to instatiate a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe “pretrained” in transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained means acquiring a model which has already been trained on a certain dataset.\nThis is common practice in many machine learning projects and is known as transfer learning.\nThe idea is to take an existing model which works well on a task similar to your target task and then fine-tune it to work even better on your target task.\nIn our case, we’re going to use the pretrained DistilBERT base model (distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) which has been trained on many thousands of books as well as a version of the English Wikipedia (millions of words).\nThis training gives it a very good baseline representation of the patterns in language.\nWe’ll take this baseline representation of the patterns in language and adjust it slightly to focus specifically on predicting whether an image caption is about food or not (based on the words it contains).\nThe main two benefits of using transfer learning are:\n\nAbility to get good results with smaller amounts of data (since the main representations are learned on a larger dataset, we only have to show the model a few examples of our specific problem).\nThis process can be repeated acorss various domains and tasks. For example, you can take a computer vision model trained on millions of images and customize it to your own use case. Or an audio model trained on many different nature sounds and customize it specifically for birds.\n\nSo when starting a new machine learning project, one of the first questions you should ask is: does an existing pretrained model similar to my task exist and can I fine-tune it for my own task?\nFor an end-to-end example of transfer learning in PyTorch (another popular deep learning framework), see PyTorch Transfer Learning.\n\n\nTime to setup our model instance.\nA few things to note: * We’ll use transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained, this will create the model architecture we specify with the pretrained_model_name_or_path parameter. * The AutoModelForSequenceClassification class comes with a classification head on top of our mdoel (so we can customize this to the number of classes we have with the num_labels parameter). * Using from_pretrained will also call the transformers.PretrainedConfig class which will enable us to set id2label and label2id parameters for our fine-tuning task.\nLet’s refresh what our id2label and label2id objects look like.\n\n# Get id and label mappings\nprint(f\"id2label: {id2label}\")\nprint(f\"label2id: {label2id}\")\n\nid2label: {0: 'not_food', 1: 'food'}\nlabel2id: {'not_food': 0, 'food': 1}\n\n\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\n# Setup model for fine-tuning with classification head (top layers of network)\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    pretrained_model_name_or_path=\"distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased\",\n    num_labels=2, # can customize this to the number of classes in your dataset\n    id2label=id2label, # mappings from class IDs to the class labels (for classification tasks)\n    label2id=label2id\n)\n\nSome weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\n\nModel created!\nYou’ll notice that a warning message gets displayed:\n\nSome weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: [‘classifier.bias’, ‘classifier.weight’, ‘pre_classifier.bias’, ‘pre_classifier.weight’] You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\nThis is essentially saying “hey, some of the layers in this model are newly initialized (with random patterns) and you should probably customize them to your own dataset”.\nThis happens because we used the AutoModelForSequenceClassification class.\nWhilst the majority of the layers in our model have already learned patterns from a large corpus of text, the top layers (classifier layers) have been randomly setup so we can customize them on our own.\nLet’s try and make a prediction with our model and see what happens.\n\n# Try and make a prediction with the loaded model (this will error)\nmodel(**tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0])\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[118], line 2\n      1 # Try and make a prediction with the loaded model (this will error)\n----&gt; 2 model(**tokenized_dataset[\"train\"][0])\n\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/ai/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1511, in Module._wrapped_call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n   1509     return self._compiled_call_impl(*args, **kwargs)  # type: ignore[misc]\n   1510 else:\n-&gt; 1511     return self._call_impl(*args, **kwargs)\n\nFile ~/miniconda3/envs/ai/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py:1520, in Module._call_impl(self, *args, **kwargs)\n   1515 # If we don't have any hooks, we want to skip the rest of the logic in\n   1516 # this function, and just call forward.\n   1517 if not (self._backward_hooks or self._backward_pre_hooks or self._forward_hooks or self._forward_pre_hooks\n   1518         or _global_backward_pre_hooks or _global_backward_hooks\n   1519         or _global_forward_hooks or _global_forward_pre_hooks):\n-&gt; 1520     return forward_call(*args, **kwargs)\n   1522 try:\n   1523     result = None\n\nTypeError: DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'text'\n\n\n\nOh no!

So rather than just a list of integers, the values become a learned representation. This learned representation comes from the base model learning how different words and word pieces relate to eachother thanks to its training data. The size of (30522, 768) means the 30,522 words in the vocabulary are all represented by vectors of size 768 (one word gets represented by 768 numbers, these are often not human interpretable).\ntransformer - This is the main body of the model. There are several TransformerBlock layers stacked on top of each other. These layers attempt to learn a deeper representation of the data going through the model. A thorough breakdown of these layers is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however, for and in-depth guide on Transformer-based models, I’d recommend reading Transformers from scratch by Peter Bloem, going through Andrej Karpathy’s lecture on Transformers and their history or reading the original Attention is all you need paper (this is the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture).\nclassifier - This is what is going to take the representation of the data and compress it into our number of target classes (notice out_features=2, this means that we’ll get two output numbers, one for each of our classes).\n\nFor more on the entire DistilBert architecture and its training setup, I’d recommend reading the DistilBert paper from the Hugging Face team.\nRather than breakdown the model itself, we’re focused on using it for a particular task (classifying text).\n\n6.1 TK - Counting the parameters of our model\nBefore we move into training, we can get another insight into our model by counting its number of parameters.\nLet’s create a small function to count the number of trainable (these will update during training) and total parameters in our model.\n\ndef count_params(model):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the parameters of a PyTorch model.\n    \"\"\"\n    trainable_parameters = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)\n    total_parameters = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())\n\n    return {\"trainable_parameters\": trainable_parameters, \"total_parameters\": total_parameters}\n\n# Count the parameters of the model\ncount_params(model)\n\n{'trainable_parameters': 66955010, 'total_parameters': 66955010}\n\n\nNice!\nLooks like our model has a total of 66,955,010 parameters and all of them are trainable.\nA parameter is a numerical value in a model which is capable of being updated to better represent the input data.\nI like to think of them as a small opportunity to learn patterns in the data.\nIf a model has three parameters, it has three small opportunities to learn patterns in the data.\nWhereas, if a model has 60,000,000+ (60M) parameters (like our model), it has 60,000,000+ small opportunities to learn patterns in the data.\nSome models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 70B have 70,000,000,000+ (70B) parameters (over 1000x our model).\nIn essence, the more parameters a model has, the more opportunities it has to learn (generally).\nMore parameters often results in more capabilities.\nHowever, more parameters also often results in a much larger model size (e.g. multiple gigabytes versus hundreds of megabytes) as well as a much longer compute time (less samples per second).\nFor our use case, a binary text classification task, 60M parameters is more than enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy count the parameters in a model?\nWhile it may be tempting to always go with a model that has the most parameters, there are many considerations to take into account before doing so.\n\nWhat hardware is the model going to run on?\n\nIf you need the model to run on cheap hardware, you’ll likely want a smaller model.\n\nHow fast do you need the model to be?\n\nIf you need 100-1000s of predictions per second, you’ll likely want a smaller model.\n\n“I don’t mind about speed or cost, I just want quality.”\n\nGo with the biggest model you can.\nHowever, often times you can get really good results by training a small model to do a specific task using quality data than by just always using a large model.\n\n\n\n\n6.2 TK - Create a directory for saving models\nTraining a model can take a while.\nSo we’ll want a place to save our models.\nLet’s create a directory called \"learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\" (it’s a bit verbose and you can change this if you like but I like to be specific).\n\n# Create model output directory\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Create models directory\nmodels_dir = Path(\"models\")\nmodels_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n# Create model save name\nmodel_save_name = \"learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\"\n\n# Create model save path\nmodel_save_dir = Path(models_dir, model_save_name)\n\nmodel_save_dir\n\nPosixPath('models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased')\n\n\n\n\n6.3 TK - Setting up training arguments with TrainingArguments\nTime to get our model ready for training!\nWe’re up to step 3 of our process:\n\nCreate and preprocess data (done ✅).\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class) (done ✅).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments.\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model.\nEvaluate results.\n\nThe transformers.TrainingArguments class contains a series of helpful items, including hyperparameter settings and model saving strategies to use throughout training.\nIt has many parameters, too many to explain here.\nHowever, the following table breaks down a helpful handful.\nSome of the parameters we’ll set are the same as the defaults (this is on purpose as the defaults are often pretty good), some such as learning_rate are different.\n\n\n\nParameter\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\noutput_dir\nName of output directory to save the model and checkpoints to. For example, ‘learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_model’.\n\n\nlearning_rate\nValue of the initial learning rate to use during training. Passed to transformers.AdamW. Initial learning rate because the learning rate can be dynamic during training. The ideal learning is experimental in nature. Defaults to 5e-5 or 0.00001 but we’ll use 0.0001.\n\n\nper_device_train_batch_size\nSize of batches to place on target device during training. For example, a batch size of 32 means the model will look at 32 samples at a time. A batch size too large will result in out of memory issues (e.g. your GPU can’t handle holding a large number of samples in memory at a time).\n\n\nper_device_eval_batch_size\nSize of batches to place on target device during evaluation. Can often be larger than during training because no gradients are being calculated. For example, training batch size could be 32 where as evaluation batch size may be able to be 128 (4x larger). Though these are only esitmates.\n\n\nnum_train_epochs\nNumber of times to pass over the data to try and learn patterns. For example, if num_train_epochs=10, the model will do 10 full passes of the training data. Because we’re working with a small dataset, 10 epochs should be fine to begin with. However, if you had a larger dataset, you may want to do a few experiments using less data (e.g. 10% of the data) for a smaller number of epochs to make sure things work.\n\n\neval_strategy\nWhen to evaluate the model on the evaluation data. If eval_strategy=\"epoch\", the model will be evaluated every epoch. See the documentation for more options. Note: This was previously called evaluation_strategy but was shortened in transformers==4.46.\n\n\nsave_strategy\nWhen to save a model checkpoint. If save_strategy=\"epoch\", a checkpoint will be saved every epoch. See the documentation for more save options.\n\n\nsave_total_limit\nNumber of total amount of checkpoints to save (so we don’t save num_train_epochs checkpoints). For example, can limit to 3 saves so the total number of saves are the 3 most recent as well as the best performing checkpoint (as per load_best_model_at_end).\n\n\nuse_cpu\nSet to False by default, will use CUDA GPU (torch.device(\"cuda\")) or MPS device (torch.device(\"mps\"), for Mac) if available. This is because training is generally faster on an accelerator device.\n\n\nseed\nSet to 42 by default for reproducibility. Meaning that subsequent runs with the same setup should achieve the same results.\n\n\nload_best_model_at_end\nWhen set to True, makes sure that the best model found during training is loaded when training finishes. This will mean the best model checkpoint gets saved regardless of what epoch it happened on. This is set to False by default.\n\n\nlogging_strategy\nWhen to log the training results and metrics. For example, if logging_strategy=\"epoch\", results will be logged as outputs every epoch. See the documentation for more logging options.\n\n\nreport_to\nLog experiments to various experiment tracking services. For example, you can log to Weights & Biases using report_to=\"wandb\". We’ll turn this off for now and keep logging to a local directory by setting report_to=\"none\".\n\n\npush_to_hub\nAutomatically upload the model to the Hugging Face Hub every time the model is saved. We’ll set push_to_hub=False as we’ll see how to do this manually later on. See the documentation for more options on saving models to the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n\nhub_token\nAdd your Hugging Face Hub token to push a model to the Hugging Face Hub with push_to_hub (will default to huggingface-cli login details).\n\n\nhub_private_repo\nWhether or not to make the Hugging Face Hub repository private or public, defaults to False (e.g. set to True if you want the repository to be private).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo get more familiar with the transformers.TrainingArguments class, I’d highly recommend reading the documentation for 15-20 minutes. Perhaps over a couple of sessions. There are quite a large number of parameters which will be helpful to be aware of.\n\n\nPhew!\nThat was a lot to take in.\nBut let’s now practice setting up our own instance of transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\n\nprint(f\"[INFO] Saving model checkpoints to: {model_save_dir}\")\n\n# Create training arguments\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=model_save_dir,\n    learning_rate=0.0001,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=32,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=32,\n    num_train_epochs=10,\n    eval_strategy=\"epoch\", # was previously \"evaluation_strategy\"\n    save_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    save_total_limit=3, # limit the total amount of save checkpoints (so we don't save num_epochs checkpoints)\n    use_cpu=False, # set to False by default, will use CUDA GPU or MPS device if available\n    seed=42, # set to 42 by default for reproducibility\n    load_best_model_at_end=True, # load the best model when finished training\n    logging_strategy=\"epoch\", # log training results every epoch\n    report_to=\"none\", # optional: log experiments to Weights & Biases/other similar experimenting tracking services (we'll turn this off for now) \n    # push_to_hub=True # optional: automatically upload the model to the Hub (we'll do this manually later on)\n    # hub_token=\"your_token_here\" # optional: add your Hugging Face Hub token to push to the Hub (will default to huggingface-cli login)\n    hub_private_repo=False # optional: make the uploaded model private (defaults to False)\n)\n\n# Optional: Print out training_args to inspect (warning, it is quite a long output)\n# training_args\n\n[INFO] Saving model checkpoints to: models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\n\n\nTraining arguments created!\nLet’s put them to work in an instance of transformers.Trainer.\n\n\n6.4 TK - Setting up an instance of Trainer\nTime for step 4!\n\nCreate and preprocess data (done ✅).\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class) (done ✅).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments. (done ✅)\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer.\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model.\nEvaluate results.\n\nThe transformers.Trainer class allows you to train models.\nIt’s built on PyTorch so it gets to leverage all of the powerful PyTorch toolkit.\nBut since it also works closely with the transformers.TrainingArguments class, it offers many helpful features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ntransformers.Trainer can work with torch.nn.Module models, however, it is designed to work best with transformers.PreTrainedModel’s from the transformers library.\nThis is not a problem for us as we’re using transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained which loads a transformers.PreTrainedModel.\nSee the transformers.Trainer documentation for tips on how to make sure your model is compatible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nmodel\nThe model we’d like to train. Works best with an instance of transformers.PreTrainedModel. Most models loaded using from_pretrained will be of this type.\n\n\nargs\nInstance of transformers.TrainingArguments. We’ll use the training_args object we defined earlier. But if this is not set, it will default to the default settings for transformers.TrainingArguments.\n\n\ntrain_dataset\nDataset to use during training. We can use our tokenized_dataset[\"train\"] as it has already been preprocessed.\n\n\neval_dataset\nDataset to use during evaluation. We can use our tokenized_dataset[\"test\"] as it has already been preprocessed.\n\n\ntokenizer\nThe tokenizer which was used to preprocess the data. Passing a tokenizer will also pad the inputs to maximum length when batching them. It will also be saved with the model so future re-runs are easier.\n\n\ncompute_metrics\nAn evaluation function to evaluate a model during training and evaluation steps. In our case, we’ll use the compute_accuracy function we defined earlier.\n\n\n\nWith all this being said, let’s build our Trainer!\n\nfrom transformers import Trainer\n\n# Setup Trainer\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset[\"test\"],\n    tokenizer=tokenizer, # Pass tokenizer to the Trainer for dynamic padding (padding as the training happens) (see \"data_collator\" in the Trainer docs)\n    compute_metrics=compute_accuracy\n)\n\nWoohoo! We’ve created our own trainer.\nWe’re one step closer to training!\n\n\n6.5 TK - Training our text classification model\nWe’ve done most the hard word setting up our transformers.TrainingArguments as well as our transformers.Trainer.\nNow how about we train a model?\nFollowing our steps:\n\nCreate and preprocess data (done ✅).\nDefine the model we’d like use with transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification (or another similar model class) (done ✅).\nDefine training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with transformers.TrainingArguments. (done ✅)\nPass TrainingArguments from 3 and target datasets to an instance of transformers.Trainer. (done ✅)\nTrain the model by calling Trainer.train().\nSave the model.\nEvaluate results.\n\nLooks like all we have to do is call transformers.Trainer.train().\nWe’ll be sure to save the results of the training to a variable results so we can inspect them later.\nLet’s try!\n\n# Train a text classification model\nresults = trainer.train()\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [70/70 00:08, Epoch 10/10]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.000300\n0.000048\n1.000000\n\n\n2\n0.000000\n0.000012\n1.000000\n\n\n3\n0.000000\n0.000006\n1.000000\n\n\n4\n0.000000\n0.000004\n1.000000\n\n\n5\n0.000000\n0.000003\n1.000000\n\n\n6\n0.000000\n0.000002\n1.000000\n\n\n7\n0.000000\n0.000002\n1.000000\n\n\n8\n0.000000\n0.000002\n1.000000\n\n\n9\n0.000000\n0.000002\n1.000000\n\n\n10\n0.000000\n0.000002\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoahhhh!!!\nHow cool is that!\nWe just trained a text classification model!\nAnd it looks like the training went pretty quick (thanks to our smaller dataset and relatively small model, for larger datasets, training would likely take longer).\nHow about we check some of the metrics?\nWe can do so using the results.metrics attribute (this returns a Python dictionary with stats from our training run).\n\n# Inspect training metrics\nfor key, value in results.metrics.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\ntrain_runtime: 8.386\ntrain_samples_per_second: 238.494\ntrain_steps_per_second: 8.347\ntotal_flos: 18110777160000.0\ntrain_loss: 3.201628114766208e-05\nepoch: 10.0\n\n\nNice!\nLooks like our overall training runtime is low because of our small dataset.\nAnd looks like our trainer was able to process a fair few samples per second.\nIf we were to 1000x the size of our dataset (e.g. ~250 samples -&gt; ~250,000 samples), it seems our training time still wouldn’t take too long.\nThe total_flos stands for “floating point operations” (also referred to as FLOPS), this is the total number of calculations our model has performed to find patterns in the data. And as you can see, it’s quite a large number!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on the hardware you’re using, the results with respect to train_runtime, train_samples_per_second and train_steps_per_second will likely be different.\nThe faster your accelerator hardware (e.g. NVIDIA GPU or Mac GPU), the lower your runtime and higher your samples/steps per second will be.\nFor reference, on my local NVIDIA RTX 4090, I get a train_runtime of 8-9 seconds, train_samples_per_second of 230-250 and train_steps_per_second of 8.565.\n\n\n\n\n6.6 TK - Save the model for later use\nNow our model has been trained, let’s save it for later use.\nWe’ll save it locally first and push it to the Hugging Face Hub later.\nWe can save our model using the transformers.Trainer.save_model method.\n\n# Save model\nprint(f\"[INFO] Saving model to {model_save_dir}\")\ntrainer.save_model(output_dir=model_save_dir)\n\n[INFO] Saving model to models/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased\n\n\nModel saved locally! Before we save it to the Hugging Face Hub, let’s check out its metrics.\n\n\n6.7 TK - Inspecting the model training metrics\nWe can get a log of our model’s training state using trainer.state.log_history.\nThis will give us a collection of metrics per epoch (as long as we set logging_strategy=\"epoch\" in transformers.TrainingArguments), in particular, it will give us a loss value per epoch.\nWe can extract these values and inspect them visually for a better understanding our model training.\nLet’s get the training history and inspect it.\n\n# Get training history \ntrainer_history_all = trainer.state.log_history \ntrainer_history_metrics = trainer_history_all[:-1] # get everything except the training time metrics (we've seen these already)\ntrainer_history_training_time = trainer_history_all[-1] # this is the same value as results.metrics from above\n\n# View the first 4 metrics from the training history\ntrainer_history_metrics[:4]\n\n[{'loss': 0.0003,\n  'grad_norm': 0.0011991249630227685,\n  'learning_rate': 9e-05,\n  'epoch': 1.0,\n  'step': 7},\n {'eval_loss': 4.8102047003339976e-05,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0188,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 2660.314,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 106.413,\n  'epoch': 1.0,\n  'step': 7},\n {'loss': 0.0,\n  'grad_norm': 0.0004598792002070695,\n  'learning_rate': 8e-05,\n  'epoch': 2.0,\n  'step': 14},\n {'eval_loss': 1.240960045834072e-05,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0186,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 2683.153,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 107.326,\n  'epoch': 2.0,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n\nOkay, looks like the metrics are logged every epochs in a list Python dictionaries with interleaving loss (this is the training set loss) and eval_loss values.\nHow about we write some code to separate the training set metrics and the evaluation set metrics?\n\nimport pprint # import pretty print for nice printing of lists\n\n# Extract training and evaluation metrics\ntrainer_history_training_set = []\ntrainer_history_eval_set = []\n\n# Loop through metrics and filter for training and eval metrics\nfor item in trainer_history_metrics:\n    item_keys = list(item.keys())\n    # Check to see if \"eval\" is in the keys of the item\n    if any(\"eval\" in item for item in item_keys):\n        trainer_history_eval_set.append(item)\n    else:\n        trainer_history_training_set.append(item)\n\n# Show the first two items in each metric set\nprint(f\"[INFO] First two items in training set:\")\npprint.pprint(trainer_history_training_set[:2])\n\nprint(f\"\\n[INFO] First two items in evaluation set:\")\npprint.pprint(trainer_history_eval_set[:2])\n\n[INFO] First two items in training set:\n[{'epoch': 1.0,\n  'grad_norm': 0.0011991249630227685,\n  'learning_rate': 9e-05,\n  'loss': 0.0003,\n  'step': 7},\n {'epoch': 2.0,\n  'grad_norm': 0.0004598792002070695,\n  'learning_rate': 8e-05,\n  'loss': 0.0,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n[INFO] First two items in evaluation set:\n[{'epoch': 1.0,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_loss': 4.8102047003339976e-05,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0188,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 2660.314,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 106.413,\n  'step': 7},\n {'epoch': 2.0,\n  'eval_accuracy': 1.0,\n  'eval_loss': 1.240960045834072e-05,\n  'eval_runtime': 0.0186,\n  'eval_samples_per_second': 2683.153,\n  'eval_steps_per_second': 107.326,\n  'step': 14}]\n\n\nBeautiful!\nHow about we take it a step further and turn our metrics into pandas DataFrames so we can view them easier?\n\n# Create pandas DataFrames for the training and evaluation metrics\ntrainer_history_training_df = pd.DataFrame(trainer_history_training_set)\ntrainer_history_eval_df = pd.DataFrame(trainer_history_eval_set)\n\ntrainer_history_training_df.head() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nloss\ngrad_norm\nlearning_rate\nepoch\nstep\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0003\n0.001199\n0.00009\n1.0\n7\n\n\n1\n0.0000\n0.000460\n0.00008\n2.0\n14\n\n\n2\n0.0000\n0.000144\n0.00007\n3.0\n21\n\n\n3\n0.0000\n0.000127\n0.00006\n4.0\n28\n\n\n4\n0.0000\n0.000095\n0.00005\n5.0\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice!\nAnd the evaluation DataFrame?\n\ntrainer_history_eval_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neval_loss\neval_accuracy\neval_runtime\neval_samples_per_second\neval_steps_per_second\nepoch\nstep\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.000048\n1.0\n0.0188\n2660.314\n106.413\n1.0\n7\n\n\n1\n0.000012\n1.0\n0.0186\n2683.153\n107.326\n2.0\n14\n\n\n2\n0.000006\n1.0\n0.0199\n2515.838\n100.634\n3.0\n21\n\n\n3\n0.000004\n1.0\n0.0219\n2287.195\n91.488\n4.0\n28\n\n\n4\n0.000003\n1.0\n0.0206\n2432.524\n97.301\n5.0\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, we’ll have follow the data explorer’s motto of visualize, visualize, visualize!

This method is similar to model card creation method above but with more customization.\n\nLet’s save our model to the Hub!\n\n# Save our model to the Hugging Face Hub\n# Note: this will be public, since we set hub_private_repo=False in our TrainingArguments\ntrainer.push_to_hub(\n    commit_message=\"Uploading food not food text classifier model\",\n    # token=\"YOUR_HF_TOKEN_HERE\" # note: this will default to the token you have saved in your Hugging Face config\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitInfo(commit_url='https://huggingface.co/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased/commit/3d1fc90784fcb62352e4169ca897ba4e4ccb92b2', commit_message='Uploading food not food text classifier model', commit_description='', oid='3d1fc90784fcb62352e4169ca897ba4e4ccb92b2', pr_url=None, pr_revision=None, pr_num=None)\n\n\nModel pushed to the Hugging Face Hub!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may see the following error:\n\n403 Forbidden: You don’t have the rights to create a model under the namespace “mrdbourke”. Cannot access content at: https://huggingface.co/api/repos/create. If you are trying to create or update content, make sure you have a token with the write role.\n\nIn this case, be sure to go through the setup steps above to make sure you have a Hugging Face access token with “write” access.\n\n\nAnd since it’s public (by default), you can see it at https://huggingface.co/mrdbourke/learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier-distilbert-base-uncased.\nYou can now share and interact with this model online.\nAs well as download it for use in your own applications.\n\nTK image - model on Hugging Face Hub ready to use/example of using the model already\n\nBut before we make an application with it, let’s keep evaluating it.",
