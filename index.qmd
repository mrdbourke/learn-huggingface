title: "Learn Hugging Face 🤗 (work in progress)"
---

Website dedicated to teaching the Hugging Face ecosystem with practical examples.

Each example will include an end-to-end approach of starting with a dataset (custom or existing), building and evaluating a model and creating a demo to share.

Teaching style: 

A machine learning cooking show! 👨‍🍳

Mottos:

* *If in doubt, run the code.* - Machine learning is very experimental. So it's good to get in the habit of continually trying things (even if you think they won't work).
* *Visualize, visualize, visualize!* - If you're not sure of some dataset or some operation or some predictions, visualize it/them.
* *Experiment, experiment, experiment!* - Again, machine learning is very experimental. So keep trying different things!

Project style:

* Create a new/reuse an existing dataset
* Train/evaluate a model
* Build a demo to share 

Prerequisites:

* 3-6 months Python experience
* 1x begineer machine learning or deep learning course 
* PyTorch experience is a bonus (see my Learn PyTorch in a Day video)

TODO:

* [ ] Ecosystem overview: transformers, datasets, accelerate, Spaces, Hub, models etc
* [ ] Practical tutorials
    * [ ] Text classification (this will be like a "start here" for the Hugging Face ecosystem)
    * [ ] More to come...
* [ ] Where to get help? HF forums, HF GitHub, etc
* [ ] Finish setup page
* [ ] Finish deployment to learnhuggingface.com page
* [ ] Make index of different projects
* [ ] Get started: text classification shows an end-to-end workflow with detailed steps, I'd advise starting here to get to know the ecosystem a bit
    * [ ] Other projects are more focused on specific tasks with less explanations but still complete code examples 

### TK - What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is a platform that offers access to many different kinds of open-source machine learning models and datasets.

They're also the creators of the popular [`transformers` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) which is a Python-based library for working with pre-trained models as well as custom models.

If you're getting into the world of AI and machine learning, you're going to come across Hugging Face.

### TK - Why Hugging Face?

Many of the biggest companies in the world use Hugging Face for their open-source machine learning projects including [Apple](https://huggingface.co/apple), [Google](https://huggingface.co/google), [Facebook](https://huggingface.co/facebook) (Meta), [Microsoft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft), [OpenAI](https://huggingface.co/openai), [ByteDance](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance) and more.

Not only does Hugging Face make it so you can use state-of-the-art machine learning models such as [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) (for image generation) and [Whipser](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) (for audio transcription) easily, it also makes it so you can share your own models, datasets and resources.

Aside from your own website, consider Hugging Face the homepage of your AI/machine learning profile.

## FAQ

> Is this an official Hugging Face website?

No, it's a personal project by myself ([Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com)) to learn and help others learn the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## How is this website made?

This is a Quarto website.
