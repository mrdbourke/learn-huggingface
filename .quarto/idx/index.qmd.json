the creators of the popular [`transformers` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) which is a Python-based library for working with pre-trained models as well as custom models.\n\nIf you're getting into the world of AI and machine learning, you're going to come across Hugging Face.\n\n* TK image - add breakdown of the Hugging Face ecosystem, `transformers`,
